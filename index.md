Hi! I am Nitin, a [Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/t-nitinkedia/) in the [AI Infrastructure group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-infrastructure/) at [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I am fortunate to work with [Dr. Ramachandrandran Ramjee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ramjee/), [Dr. Jayashree Mohan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jamohan/), [Dr. Ashish Panwar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ashishpanwar/) and [Dr. Nipun Kwatra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nkwatra/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer systems and machine learning, with a current focus on optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference.

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Zeta](https://zeta.tech), [a unicorn startup modernizing legacy banking systems with a cloud-native stack](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/zeta-amazon-eks/). During my three years there, I scaled the Web Application Infrastructure, delivering it to HDFC Bank (India's largest private bank), and expansion to the US; and developed Zetaâ€™s API Playground. I also interned at [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com), in the [ads app](https://advertising.flipkart.com/) team.

I graduated with a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/) in 2020. I have fond memories of competing in programming contests at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/nk7). See this [repo](https://github.com/nitinkedia7/competitive-coding) for fast plug-n-play data structures and algorithm implementations in C++.

**_Iâ€™m looking for PhD positions. Please feel free to reach out if you think I might be a good fit._**
